on edit page load, take value in grid_sizex and grid_sizey and set the li
items as such

make sure that user can't make a tile that extends past column 6

go to crop page after selecting background image for about_me and for showreel
  Also later for contact page

Write model/contact_spec to test cases of email addresses and blanks
before/after email
