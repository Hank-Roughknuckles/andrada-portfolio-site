Fix bug where mySlider.js makes all the preview slides in the edit page fade out

Preview slide isn't showing anything when edit page first loads

Make the edit page for each slide actually display the content slide in the edit page so she can see what it looks like without having to save and go to the home page
  -DRY out the content in the about_me_contents/edit.html.erb file to where it will automatically be the same as that in the index.html.erb file

make method for title that will display just "Andrada Popan-Dorca" if no title is yielded by the page

change cursor when over slider buttons to be the finger pointing (like when you mouse over a link)

Make the nav-bar auto adjust spacing based on size of elements so that the navbar always ONLY takes up one line

Make uploaded image appear on the "edit" page before user selects save

when something is changed without saving on the admin page, make a popup appear that says "You have made changes, but have not saved them.  Click the "Save" button at the bottom

center navbar within the home screen
